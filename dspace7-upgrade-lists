# DSpace 7 upgrade/migration lists

Some lists of tips, notes, links related to upgrading a DSpace repository to 7.x or migrating from another platform to DSpace 7.x

## In my experience, things to consider:

* _New technology_: nodejs/angular, front/backend communication
* _Non-volatile Solr data_: statistics, authority
* _URLs_: redirection, rewriting, persistent IDs, saved searches, etc.
* _Customisations_: Blank slate? Submit to official codebase? Port/rewrite?
* _Other changes_: A good opportunity to introduce other big changes? Or a trap to bog down a migration project?
* _Entities_: transform/implement as part of migration?

## Wiki links

* [Official DSpace 7 documentation](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x) includes upgrade advice and instructions, some troubleshooting FAQ
* On the wiki a page called [DSpace 7 UI Optimization Analysis](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+7+UI+Optimization+Analysis) covers optimisation findings so far. They should be integrated with main documentation but it is a good page to watch
* Another wiki page which is still maintained: https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSDOC7x/Performance+Tuning+DSpace

## OR2023 links related to DSpace 7 upgrading/migrating/implementing
* [Adopting the DSpace 7 platform: challenges, gaps, problematics, and solution formulas from real migration experiences](https://zenodo.org/record/8075512) by 4science covers some lessons learned from various migrations and implementations
* [Update to DSpace 7](https://zenodo.org/record/8074863) is a workshop from Stellenbosch University that covered basic upgrades
* The [DSpace 8 release status page](https://wiki.lyrasis.org/display/DSPACE/DSpace+Release+8.0+Status) covers priorities, timelines, and status of the upcoming 8.0 major release. No more features will be introduced for DSpace 7, only bugfixes and improvements.
* [An update on DSpace CRIS, the state of the art tool for Research & Information management](https://zenodo.org/record/8091577) covers DSpace CRIS 7 -- **not** the same as DSpace 7 but shares a large common code base and continues to merge closer. It aims to be both repository and CRIS.
* [Modeling Digital Cultural Landscapes with DSpace](https://zenodo.org/record/8091676) introduces DSpace GLAM 7, which, similar to DSpace CRIS 7, extends/diverges from a common code base to provide a single platform focused on GLAM solutions
* [dspace-rest-client: A Python REST client library for DSpace 7](https://zenodo.org/record/8091637) shows my python rest client which might help with some upgrades or migrations, if python integration/tools are a good fit
* ...an [Open Repositories 2023 zenodo search](https://zenodo.org/search?page=1&size=20&q="DSpace%207"&keywords=OR2023) should find all relevant papers from OR2023
